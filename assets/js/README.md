This folder contains a AWS SDK JS build that only has following services included:

- AWS.STS
- AWS.CognitoIdentity
- AWS.CognitoIdentityServiceProvider
- AWS.Location
- AWS.CognitoSync

Since default browser version did not include Location service, I had to use the (SDK Builder)[https://sdk.amazonaws.com/builder/js/].
